<h1>@GetTheWeather</h1>

<p>GetTheWeather is a simple application I put together in <b>Python</b> using the Twitter API (facilitated by <a href="https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython">Twython</a>).</p>

<p>It works like this: Simply send a tweet with your location enabled (geotagged) to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gettheweather">@GetTheWeather</a> on twitter and you'll get a reply with the weather or forecast in your area within a minute!</p>

<p>This was the first in a series of Twitter projects I intend to do which involve providing the user with the information they need in a timely manner on a platform they are comfortable with and using often.</p>
